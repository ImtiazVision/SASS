# SASS 

**SASS** : SASS, or Syntactically Awesome Style Sheet, is a CSS preprocessor. SASS is written in the Ruby programming language. 

### Benefits of usage :

- It makes it possible for us to develop style sheets more quickly.
- Allows us to utilize variables, nested rules, functions, and mixins to extend the capability of CSS.

### Syntax : 

SASS recognizes two forms of syntax: 

1. SASS Syntax
2. SCSS Syntax 

**SASS Syntax** : Indentation is used to indicate code blocks, while newlines are used to divide lines inside a block. The.sass extension is used to save these files.

**SCSS Syntax** : SCSS is a CSS syntax extension (Sassy syntax). Curly braces are used to mark code blocks, while semicolons are used to divide lines inside a block. The.scss extension is used to store these files.

```
.new {

       color:#0035df;

       font-weight:bold;

      }

span {

       text-transform:lowercase;

      }
```
